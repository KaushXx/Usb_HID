🔐 USB HID Warning Message Demo
This project is a harmless USB HID (Human Interface Device) demo created using an Arduino-compatible microcontroller such as the Arduino Pro Micro or Digispark. When plugged into a Windows machine, the device emulates a keyboard and automatically executes a sequence of keystrokes that:

Opens the Windows Run dialog (Win + R)

Launches the Command Prompt

Creates a temporary VBScript file that displays a fake warning message box simulating a security breach

🛑 Important Note:
This project is purely educational and does not harm or modify the system in any way. The goal is to demonstrate how easily USB HID devices can be used for social engineering or awareness training.

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated:

USB HID emulation with Arduino

Command automation via keystrokes

VBScript for fake alerts

Awareness of USB-based attack vectors

✅ Safe for labs and demonstrations
🚫 Not for malicious use
